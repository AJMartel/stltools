.Sh NAME
.Nm stl2ps
.Nd Projects an STL file on the xy plane and renders a PostScript figure of it.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm 
infile
.Op Ar outfile
.Op x Ar degrees | y Ar degrees | z Ar degrees ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents version 
.Ql VERSION
of the 
.Nm
program. This program is able to render a globally illuminated projection of
an STL file as PostScript output. First, the STL file is parsed. Both binary
and text STL file can be read. Next, all the triangles in the file are rotated
around the axis of the global coordinate system, as specified by the sequence
of rotation options. 
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Sh COMPATIBILITY
The 
.Nm
program requires the Python interpreter. It was written for version 2.7, but
should be able to work with 3.x after fixing with
.Xr 2to3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr python 1 ,
.Xr stl2pov 1 ,
.Xr 2to3.

.Sh HISTORY
The origin of this software was found in the desire of the author to render 3D
CAD models using the POV-ray raytracer. The first effort produced the
.Xr stl2pov 1
program, written in C. 
.Pp
Later the author converted that program to Python as a learning
experience. This rendered a more re-usable version of the software to parse
STL files as a python module. Adding this front-end for outputting a
PostScript rendering now became much easier.
